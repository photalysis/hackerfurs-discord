Q.1: Do I have to be furry to join? How do I know I'm furry?
A.1: This is a common question for people new to the fandom. "Furry" can be many things that are in between mere interest, subculture, and lifestyle, depending upon who you ask. It is very diverse, and notoriously difficult to categorize. There is no test for furriness, relax! You'll find your niche.

Q.2: What about tech? How do I know I'm devoted enough to be here?
A.2: There is a rapidly growing number of new tech workers. You are welcome at any stage of learning here, but please respect the time and attention of others by reading on your own time and phrasing questions in a way that is concise and descriptive - everyone has different boundaries when it comes to helpfulness. If you are concerned that your questions are too many or too thick, there is always the tech-newbies channel!
