# Welcome to the unofficial hackerfurs discord.

This is a furry server for fauna with an interest in tech - the old IRC channel can be found at #hackerfurs on irc.anthrochat.net:6667 .

## FAQ
**Q.1: Do I have to be furry to join? How do I know I'm furry?**

A.1: This is a common question for people new to the fandom. "Furry" can be many things that are in between mere interest, subculture, and lifestyle, depending upon who you ask. It is very diverse, and notoriously difficult to categorize. There is no test for furriness, relax! You'll find your niche.

**Q.2: What about tech? How do I know I'm devoted enough to be here?**

A.2: There is a rapidly growing number of new tech workers. You are welcome at any stage of learning here, but please respect the time and attention of others by reading on your own time and phrasing questions in a way that is concise and descriptive - everyone has different boundaries when it comes to helpfulness. If you are concerned that your questions are too many or too thick, there is always the tech-newbies channel!

**Q.3: What is the relation to the #hackerfurs IRC channel?**

A.3: We're currently a split-off community, motivated by low user activity and the increasing unattractiveness of IRC as a platform in the face of modern alternatives. Some members may be shared, but adminship is different. The server name could change if the atmosphere becomes distinct enough.

## Culture & Guidelines
Hackerfurs Discord is a place where positivity and growth are encouraged. We try to have some self-respect without taking ourselves too seriously. That isn't to say that the negative aspects of life and art are denied, only that members should be aware of how the content and tone of what they say affects others and the space as a whole. Negativity is not taboo, but neither is it venerated; it is made visible for the purpose of understanding and overcoming it.

Admins must see themselves as peers and equals, who must follow their own guidelines and accept criticism, and must have an investment in improving and maintaining the community. In nearly all instances, disputes or rule breaking are resolved through discussion. Kicks or bans are a tool of last resort for when a user is acting "trollish," by refusing to participate in the mediating process.

Members should be able to have confidence that they can voice concerns or criticism without fear of reprisal.

While we can't guarantee that HFD is a safe space, we do make efforts to be inclusive. This means any conversation that creates an overtly unwelcoming atmosphere for people of a particular race, class, gender, sexuality, nationality, (dis)ability, or religion is not allowed. Irony is a functionally invalid excuse - it is difficult to prove how sincere any person is being, and if users must constantly guess the sincerity of content it undermines the foundations of meaningful communication.

## Rules
1. Nazis and white supremacism are not allowed here. This includes /pol/speak.
2. NSFW content goes in the appropriate channels.
3. Personal pronouns are respected here - see the user's notes by clicking their icon in the sidebar.
